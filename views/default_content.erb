## Using curl

If you want to use curl to convert your Markdown you can POST to http://markdownviewer.herokuapp.com/render passing your Markdown in a variable called _content_.

> curl --data "content=#This is a title" http://markdownviewer.herokuapp.com/render

To send a file (with your Markdown in) use the following, replacing filename.txt with the name of your file
