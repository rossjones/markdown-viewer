# Markdown viewer

Thought I'd take the opportunity to start learning Ruby, and try out Sinatra at the same time. 

Don't expect anything fancy, it just accepts Markdown and displays HTML (source, or rendered) when you click a button, but it might be useful for *something*. Or not.

You can try out the app at [http://markdownviewer.herokuapp.com/](http://markdownviewer.herokuapp.com/).
